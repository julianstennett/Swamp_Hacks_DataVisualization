This project will use a public datasheet to map coordinates of algal blooms within the specified area. This information will be useful for understanding the environmental impact, concentration, and causes of these harmful freshwater algal blooms. In addition, this can fit into the theme of exploring the unkown as viable solutions to polution and water quality are still out of reach, and by understanding this, we can come one step closer to how to deal with the issue and build infastructure to support progress. With that said this project will be a data visualization of the public dataset depicting the location of harmful algal blooms in California. 
Some tkinter framework information & project references github - TomSchimansky. Data comes from data.ca.gov - california open data portal.
